Textbooks often simplify this to large-sample vs. small-sample methods use normal distribution with large samples and t-distribution with small samples. This is right almost all the time, because in real sampling problems we seldom have a basis for knowing σ. However, there can be some situations when we do have a basis for assuming a value for σ, such as using a σ based on past data, and in those situations even if sample size is small the correct procedure would be to use the normal distribution, so the simplified large-sample vs. small sample approach would lead to an error.
